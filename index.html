                            <p class="vv3">Our club has started a Bal Vatsalya Kendra in Amreli. Basically it’s a child development & educational training centre for rural & slum area children. This project is started after a motivational visit of Happy School of RC Rajkot Greater and Dhinka Chika project by Surat during Pravas - Car Rally organized by RID 3060. We identified slum areas in the city and surveyed for the childrens in this areas. We approached many institutions for a hand of help and luckily SBI – RSETI has agreed to help us and provided us the place in their institute. We arraigned a care taker for this childrens and started this centre on 22nd of Feb 2021. We are glad to see that on the very 1st day of this centre, nearly 35 childrens were present and this figure is now increasing day by day. As of now there are 109 childrens coming to this centre. Care taker trains these childrens on how to Brush teeth, taking Bath, Combing their Hair & Dressing, etc. Club member Rtn. Suresh Trivedi & Rtn. Tapan Sanghvi looks after this project and also teaches the childrens basic knowledge. This centre is open daily from 8:30 to 11:30 in morning and a healthy meal is giving to all children which attract them for coming here. Our aim is to educate maximum children of slum areas. Recurring cost of around Rs.6000-8000/- is barred by club members and SBI-RSETI. By this project club is gaining public image in the lower class of the society.</p>
